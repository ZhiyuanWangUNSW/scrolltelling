    <h2>Our Position</h2>

      Every health professional must learn how to provide quality health care to people with intellectual disability because everyone has the right to
      <span class="kw" tabindex="0">safe</span>,
      <span class="kw" tabindex="0">respectful</span>,
      <span class="kw" tabindex="0">effective</span> and

<section id= "prob" class="scroll-block snap">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    People with intellectual disability experience some of the poorest health outcomes in Australia. Many of these outcomes are preventable with better access to inclusive, high-quality care.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the document notes, <em>“University courses teach very little, if anything, about intellectual disability…”</em> and most health professionals are not required to complete training in this area.
  </p>

  <p>
    This gap leaves much of the workforce underprepared to deliver accessible and equitable care.
  </p>
</section>

<section id= "sol" class="scroll-block snap">
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>
    Better education and training is one of the top requests made by people with intellectual disability. The Position Statement calls for a coordinated national approach to upskill today’s and tomorrow’s health workforce.
  </p>

  <p>
    Training must be grounded in human rights, reflect lived experience, encourage self-reflection, and align with best-practice person-centred care.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Lucy, a project worker with lived experience, says:
    <em>“All health workers need to respect people with intellectual disability and treat them with fairness…”</em>
  </p>
</section>

<section id= "rec" class="scroll-block snap">
  <h2>Key Recommendations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Make intellectual disability education compulsory in all tertiary health courses.</li>
    <li>Increase opportunities for clinical and non-clinical placements involving people with intellectual disability.</li>
    <li>Actively involve people with intellectual disability and their support networks in designing and delivering training.</li>
    <li>Require intellectual disability training for all health professionals in public hospitals and emergency services.</li>
    <li>Ensure peak bodies and specialist colleges promote CPD opportunities.</li>
    <li>Embed intellectual disability content in specialty training curricula.</li>
    <li>Expand high-quality training and advanced pathways for those who wish to specialise.</li>
    <li>Provide health professionals with the time, resources and support needed to apply their training.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id= "how" class="scroll-block snap">
  <h2>How This Statement Was Created</h2>
  <p>
    The Position Statement draws on best evidence and insights from people with intellectual disability, families, carers, health professionals, educators, researchers and advocates.
