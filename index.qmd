<section class="scroll-block">
  <h2>Our Position</h2>
  <p>
    Every health professional must learn how to provide quality health care to people with intellectual disability because everyone has the right to safe, respectful, effective and inclusive health care.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="scroll-block">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    People with intellectual disability experience some of the poorest health outcomes in Australia. Many of these outcomes are preventable with better access to inclusive, high-quality care.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the document notes, <em>“University courses teach very little, if anything, about intellectual disability…”</em> and most health professionals are not required to complete training in this area.
  </p>

  <p>
    This gap leaves much of the workforce underprepared to deliver accessible and equitable care.
  </p>

<section class="scroll-block">
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>
    Better education and training is one of the top requests made by people with intellectual disability. The Position Statement calls for a coordinated national approach to upskill today’s and tomorrow’s health workforce.
  </p>

  <p>
    Training must be grounded in human rights, reflect lived experience, encourage self-reflection, and align with best-practice person-centred care.
  </p>

  <p>
    As Lucy, a project worker with lived experience, says:
    <em>“All health workers need to respect people with intellectual disability and treat them with fairness…”</em>
